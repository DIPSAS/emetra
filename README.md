Low-level libraries and components from **FastTrak** application.  Existing code that has passed peer review will be moved here based on a set of critera, the code ...

1. Is used by **FastTrak** and/or related tools
2. Has functionality that is general in or can be useful to other teams.
3. Has a quality that we are at least **happy** with, if not proud of (as opposed just satisfied).
4. Is well documented with XML style comments and references.
5. Does not contain secrets of any kind (passwords, usernames, API-keys etc).
6. Has passed review from at least to members of our team, where items 1-5 are addressed.

The documentation should preferably be done with a tool that supports references, 
like [Documentation Insight](http://www.devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/ "Documentation Insight") 
from [DevJet Software](http://www.devjetsoftware.com/ "DevJet software").
